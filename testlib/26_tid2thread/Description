Does tid2thread return the right thread?

This is the similar numbersmain program distributed with the
assignment, but with a scheduler that returns a random thread.
(seeded, so reproducible).  After 50 iterations, the last thread runs
through the list of all threads and sees if tid2thread is returning
the right context.
